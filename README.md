# 🖋 Python InputLogger Ethical (Safe Simulation)

A **harmless, local-only** keylogging simulation built in Python for ethical cybersecurity training and detection practice.  
Designed to demonstrate attacker techniques while providing a safe, controlled lab environment.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project is an **ethical keylogger simulation** that records keystrokes locally without transmitting data over the network.  
It’s intended for:
- Cybersecurity students learning about input capture attacks.
- SOC analysts practicing detection in sandboxed environments.
- Demonstrating offensive tactics for purple team exercises.

**Why It Matters**  
Keylogging is a common attacker technique (MITRE ATT&CK: `T1056.001 – Input Capture`).  
Security professionals must understand:
- How keyloggers operate.
- What logs they leave behind.
- How to detect and mitigate them
